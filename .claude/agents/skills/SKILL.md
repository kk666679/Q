# HRMS Skill Profile — July 2026

## 1. Profile Summary

HRMS (Human Resources Management System) is a multi-tenant HR and foreign worker management platform combining modern full-stack web engineering, Malaysian labour compliance workflows, and AI-assisted multi-agent orchestration. The system spans end-to-end type-safe API design, domain-specific HR automation, geolocation tracking, PDF generation, on-device ML embeddings, and structured knowledge routing for specialist agents.

**Key strengths**

- **End-to-end type-safe architecture**: TypeScript → tRPC → Zod → Prisma → PostgreSQL
- **Deep Malaysian HR compliance** and foreign worker management domain coverage
- **Multi-agent AI orchestration** with LLM tool-calling and local embedding fallback
- **Multi-tenant data modeling** with strict tenant-scoped query discipline
- **Schema-first development** with Zod v4 as the single source of truth for forms, APIs, and AI tools
- **Financial precision** with Decimal.js for payroll and statutory calculations
- **Real-time streaming** with Vercel AI SDK and Server-Sent Events

## 5. Skill Gaps & Recommendations (July 2026)

### High Priority

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| **Automated testing stack** | Critical for tRPC procedures, Zod schemas, compliance logic, payroll calculations | Implement Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E. Target 80% coverage on critical paths. |
| **Observability & monitoring** | Essential for production support of compliance-critical workflows | Add Sentry for error tracking, structured logging (Pino/Winston), OpenTelemetry for tracing. |
| **Authentication hardening** | `jose` present but no dedicated auth library | Integrate NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js) with RBAC patterns formalized across tenant boundaries. |
| **Rate limiting & security** | No protection against API abuse or brute force | Implement upstash/ratelimit or Next.js built-in rate limiting for API routes. |

### Medium Priority

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| **CI/CD standardization** | GitHub Actions exist but coverage should be verified | Enforce lint, type-check, Prisma schema validation, build gates, and test runs. |
| **Vector database / persistent embeddings** | Current semantic search uses in-memory similarity | Add pgvector extension to PostgreSQL or migrate to Pinecone for scalable knowledge base. |
| **OpenAI model versioning** | `gpt-4o-mini` hardcoded | Create model configuration layer for safe upgrades and cost control without code changes. |
| **Ollama model registry** | Specific local model(s) not documented | Document which models are used (e.g., llama3.2, mistral) and version them in config. |
| **Audit logging** | Compliance requires action trails | Implement structured audit log for all HR changes, visa updates, payroll approvals. |

### Low Priority

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| **Skill metadata automation** | Manual updates risk drift | Generate/update profile from `package.json` and intent-skills source files on each release. |
| **Cross-team glossary** | Naming drift across modules and agent prompts | Create shared taxonomy for HR, engineering, and AI terms (PLKS vs Work Permit vs Visa). |
| **Rive animation governance** | Minimal usage, risk of duplication | Define pattern for when Rive vs Framer Motion should be used. |
| **DnD Kit adoption** | `@dnd-kit/react` installed but no skill entry | Confirm active usage or remove dependency. |
| **Documentation versioning** | Multiple SKILL.md files may drift | Implement centralized version tracking or cross-reference validation in CI. |
